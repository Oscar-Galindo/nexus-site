  },
  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What does this actually cost?',
      answer: 'Investment starts at $2,500/month. Final pricing depends on scope — what systems you need managed, how complex your operations are, and how much is already in place. We figure that out on the call.',
    },
    {
      question: "What's included?",
      answer: "Whatever falls under digital operations for your organization. Website, hosting, content, CRM, automations, email workflows, vendor coordination. If it lives online and keeps your business running, it's likely in scope. If it's not, I'll tell you.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to pay for tools and software separately?',
      answer: "Yes. You're paying for the expertise and execution — not the tools. If your setup needs a CMS, email platform, phone numbers, domains, or anything with a subscription, those costs are yours. I'll recommend what makes sense, set it up, and run it. You own the accounts and pay the vendors directly.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I reach you when I need something?',
      answer: "You get a client portal. Submit requests, upload files, chat directly — all in one place. No email chains. No wondering if I saw it. When I'm working on something, you'll see it.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How fast do things get done?',
      answer: "Depends on the request. Routine updates happen within 24-48 hours. Larger projects get scoped and scheduled. You'll always know the timeline — no guessing.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the commitment?",
      answer: "Month-to-month after an initial 90-day period. The first three months let us build systems and establish rhythm. After that, you stay because it's working — not because you're locked in.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Why one person instead of an agency or team?',
      answer: "One person means one point of accountability. No handoffs. No re-explaining context. No waiting for someone to \"loop in\" the right person. I know your operation because I'm the one running it.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if this isn't working?",
      answer: "We talk about it. If something's off, I want to know. If it's truly not a fit, you walk away with everything documented and transitioned cleanly. No hostage situations.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you work with my industry?',
      answer: "I've worked with Fortune 500 companies, healthcare systems, nonprofits, startups, and local businesses. Industry matters less than operational complexity. If you have digital infrastructure that needs to run reliably, we can talk.",
    },
  ],
  pricing: {
    headline: 'Starting at $2,500/month.',
    subheadline: "Scope determines the final number. More systems, more complexity, more involvement — the investment reflects that. We'll figure out exactly what you need on the call.",
  },
